# Beaverutils is coreutils recreated in Golang

## Go Coreutils
This project aims to provide a Go-based implementation of various commands found
in the GNU Core Utilities (coreutils). The goal is to recreate these utilities in Go,
emphasizing readability, maintainability, and idiomatic Go practices.

It uses the current features the language offers in its libraries to make it easy
to the user read and understand what's written there.

Coreutils is a vast set of tools used everyday by UNIX users worldwide.
The intention of this project is not whatsoever be a replacement for Cureutils,
the original repository and all needed links are listed on the Subtitle **Disclaimer**.
My goal is to study golang and improve my own UNIX system comprehension.


## Structure
The project follows a structure where each utility is located in a separate 
directory within the src folder. This approach allows for a modular and organized codebase.
